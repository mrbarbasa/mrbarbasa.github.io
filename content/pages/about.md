I'm a software engineer transitioning into the field of machine learning and AI. I'm passionate about natural language processing, and I'm hoping to start my new career in AI by seeking a Machine Learning Engineer role, preferably within the NLP problem domain.

I'm currently self-studying full-time and enrolled in the <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science" target="_blank">MITx MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science</a> (SDS) program and have thus far completed a <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/probability-the-science-of-uncertainty-and-data-0" target="_blank">Probability course</a>. In 2018, I have graduated from four of Udacity's Nanodegree programs: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t" target="_blank">Machine Learning Engineer</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893" target="_blank">Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>, and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a>.

My current goal is to achieve the Google Cloud Platform Professional Data Engineer Certification by April 2019.

At present, I'm located in Hawaii but plan to move to the Bay Area (preferable) or Seattle for a new career in machine learning and NLP.

Prior to this goal of self-study, I developed various JavaScript web applications at <a href="https://sudokrew.com/" target="_blank">Sudokrew</a> for clients in the education and energy industries, and beforehand, worked at <a href="http://www.boeing.com/" target="_blank">Boeing</a> for two years, developing and maintaining C# and Java web applications for internal customers. I graduated from <a href="https://www.devleague.com/" target="_blank">DevLeague</a>, Hawaii's first coding bootcamp, in 2015 and from the <a href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</a> with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2012.

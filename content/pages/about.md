I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in machine learning, particularly natural language processing. But for my next role, I'd love to gain more experience with backend engineering for distributed systems at scale, since I've primarily worked at smaller companies in the past. My other role interests involve developer tooling, the AR/VR space, developing iOS apps using Swift, and opportunities to work with the Go programming language.

I'm currently on the job hunt for remote software engineering roles, aiming to start applying in January 2022. I'm located in Hawaii but intend to move to the continental U.S. at some point in 2022.

Beforehand, I worked as a Data Engineering Contractor at AddShoppers and as a Machine Learning Engineer at Toucan AI (wearing many hats there, including Full-Stack / DevOps / UI/UX Engineer). At Toucan AI, I worked alongside the CEO and CTO in developing an AI salesperson chatbot to help elevate shoppers' experience on ecommerce websites. It was a joy to have spent most of my time working on challenging NLP problems and to investigate modern or state-of-the-art research and approaches that we could apply to our conversational AI.

I was fortunate to have made that transition to an ML opportunity, because before Toucan AI, I had dedicated myself to self-studying ML full-time and had graduated from four of Udacity's AI-related Nanodegree programs in 2018.

Prior to my journey of ML self-study, I developed various JavaScript (primarily Node.js and React) web applications at <a href="https://sudokrew.com/" target="_blank">Sudokrew</a> for clients in the education and energy industries for three years, and beforehand, worked at <a href="http://www.boeing.com/" target="_blank">Boeing</a> for two years, developing and maintaining C# and Java web applications for internal customers. I graduated from <a href="https://www.devleague.com/" target="_blank">DevLeague</a>, Hawaii's first coding bootcamp, in 2015 and from the <a href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</a> with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2012.

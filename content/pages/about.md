Slug: about

I'm a software engineer with 7+ years of industry experience seeking a full-time Software Engineer role. I've worked on a range of production web applications, using tools from Java, C#, and SQL Server to Node.js, JavaScript, React, Docker, Python, and various cloud services. I'm comfortable at all levels of the technology stack, development process, and deployment process but am looking for more of a backend, developer tools, or infrastructure-oriented role. My current strongest languages are Python and JavaScript, but I'm always open to learning new tools as necessary for the job.

I graduated from DevLeague, Hawaii's first coding bootcamp, in 2015 and from the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2012. I have a strong interest in machine learning, particularly natural language processing, and am currently interested in personal finance, personal wellness, board game design, and building mobile apps. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, taking courses, playing board games (especially Agricola and Hanabi) and video games, solving jigsaw puzzles, and watching productions.

I'm located in Hawaii but intend to move to the Puget Sound area by September 2022. I'd prefer a remote role but would consider hybrid and onsite in or near Seattle, Bellevue, or Redmond.

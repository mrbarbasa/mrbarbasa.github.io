I'm a JavaScript full-stack web developer looking to transition into the field of machine learning and AI. Currently, I'm self-studying full-time and enrolled in the <a href="https://www.edx.org/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science" target="_blank">MITx MicroMasters in Statistics and Data Science</a> program and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893" target="_blank">Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree</a> program. I have graduated from <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t" target="_blank">Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer</a>, <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/natural-language-processing-nanodegree--nd892" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a>, and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree</a> programs in 2018.

Prior to this goal of self-study, I developed various JavaScript web applications at <a href="https://sudokrew.com/" target="_blank">Sudokrew</a> for clients in the education and energy industries, and beforehand, worked at <a href="http://www.boeing.com/" target="_blank">Boeing</a> for two years, developing and maintaining C# and Java web applications for internal customers. I graduated from <a href="https://www.devleague.com/" target="_blank">DevLeague</a>, Hawaii's first coding bootcamp, in 2015 and from the <a href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa</a> with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2012.

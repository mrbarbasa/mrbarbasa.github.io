Summary: How my journey into machine learning began.

Fall 2011. Attended an AI course at university. There was a lecture on grammar parsing.

Attended another course on using AI in games. Implemented A* search in C++ for the <a href="https://www.bzflag.org/" target="_blank">BZFlag</a> game.

Yet not a whisper of machine learning or deep learning. And I did not wish to become a game developer.

Spring 2015. Studied at <a href="https://www.devleague.com/" target="_blank">DevLeague</a>, Hawaii's first web development and coding bootcamp. An idea for my final project: A generative text, collaborative web app for writing fiction or nonfiction. Two or more persons at a time would be able to write, and if idle for a time, the app would come up with prompts/questions to relieve writer's block.

Yet it could not be done, since I knew nothing of machine learning. It was just a trendy word, foreign to me.

Spring 2016. With a Hawaii makers' group called <a href="http://hicapacity.org/" target="_blank">HICapacity</a>. Enter the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a> course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. A lot of the subject matter went over my head, I could not keep up with the programming assignments, and I was none too eager about Octave.

Yet the content was fascinating and challenging.

It was applied math, science, data, and programming rolled into one.

It was about transforming what is known into what could be.

It was about using similar tools to solve real-world problems across industries.

It rekindled my love for math and science, and I was hooked.

Since 2016, I studied machine learning on and off but never felt like I was headed anywhere. And whenever it got busy at work, it was difficult to get back into machine learning after an extended period away from it.

This year, I decided to become serious about machine learning and pursue it as a career. In May 2018, I left my most beloved job at <a href="https://sudokrew.com/" target="_blank">Sudokrew</a> working as a JavaScript web developer. Since then, I've been studying machine learning every day, nonstop.

And it's been a fun, at times overwhelming, journey thus far.

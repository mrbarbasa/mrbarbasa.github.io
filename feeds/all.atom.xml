Attended an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; course at &lt;a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;university&lt;/a&gt;. There was a lecture on grammar&amp;nbsp;parsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attended another course on using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; in games. Implemented A* search in C++ for the &lt;a href="https://www.bzflag.org/" target="_blank"&gt;BZFlag&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet not a whisper of machine learning or deep learning. And I did not wish to become a game&amp;nbsp;developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring 2015. Studied at &lt;a href="https://www.devleague.com/" target="_blank"&gt;DevLeague&lt;/a&gt;, Hawaii&amp;#8217;s first web development and coding bootcamp. An idea for my final project: A generative text, collaborative web app for writing fiction or nonfiction. Two or more persons at a time would be able to write, and if idle for a †ime, the app would come up with prompts/questions to relieve writer&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it could not be done, since I knew nothing of machine learning. It was just a trendy word, foreign to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring 2016. With a Hawaii makers&amp;#8217; group called &lt;a href="http://hicapacity.org/" target="_blank"&gt;HICapacity&lt;/a&gt;. Enter the &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank"&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; course by Andrew Ng on Coursera. A lot of the subject matter went over my head, I could not keep up with the programming assignments, and I was none too eager about&amp;nbsp;Octave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the content was fascinating and&amp;nbsp;challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was applied math, science, data, and programming rolled into&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about transforming what is known into what could&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was about using similar tools to solve real-world problems across&amp;nbsp;industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rekindled my love for math and science, and I was&amp;nbsp;hooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, I studied machine learning on and off but never felt like I was headed anywhere. And whenever it got busy at work, it was difficult to get back into machine learning after an extended period away from&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I decided to become serious about machine learning and pursue it as a career. In May 2018, I left my most beloved job at &lt;a href="https://sudokrew.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Sudokrew&lt;/a&gt; working as a JavaScript web developer. Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve been studying machine learning every day,&amp;nbsp;nonstop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#8217;s been a fun, at times overwhelming, journey thus&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="machine-learning personal"></category></entry></feed>
